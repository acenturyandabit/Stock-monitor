## I'm looking to practice buying stocks!
You've come to the right place! 

This site is fantastic because:
- There's no sign up and no committment. Ever.
- Never give us any of your details: no credit card or ID required.

Some caveats:
- This site allows you to emulate buying stocks for the Australian Stock Exchange only.
- Prices lag by at least 20 minutes and at most an hour, depending on site load.

For support:
- No, I can't replace any lost data if you accidentally wipe your portfolio. Sorry :(
- If you want to suggest a feature, pop an issue on github in the tabs above ^
- Or, if you don't have a github account, you can email me directly at steeven.liu2@gmail.com

## I want to help polish this product.
- The todo list is as below:
  - restyle everything
